/*
 Create custom annotation to represent meta data as described:-Create annotation One is the Author Annotation and the other
is the Version Annotation.
import java.lang.annotation.*;
@Target(value = { ElementType.CONSTRUCTOR, ElementType.METHOD, ElementType.TYPE })
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
public @interface Author {
String name() default "unknown";
}
Notes: Note the definition of the Author annotation. This is a single-valued Annotation meaning that this Annotation has a single
property called name. Also make a note of the Target Annotation. The presence of Target Annotation tells that Author
Annotation can only be applied to Java elements like Constructor, Method and Type (Class/Interface). Another important thing
to note is the Retention for this Annotation is set to Run-time because we want this Annotation information to be available to the
JVM while the program is running. The name property is also given a default value
unknown if the consuming Application fail to provide an explicit value. Following is the definition of the Version
Annotation. It looks exactly the same as
Author Annotation except the fact that it has a property called number (which is of type double) to hold the version value.
Version.java
@Target(value = { ElementType.CONSTRUCTOR, ElementType.METHOD, ElementType.TYPE })
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
public @interface Version {
double number();
}
Let us have a look at the following class definition that makes use of the above declared Annotations. The Annotations are applied
at the class-level as well as in the
@Author(name = "Johny")
@Version(number = 1.0)
public class AnnotatedClass {
@Author(name = "Author1")
@Version(number = 2.0f)
public void annotatedMethod1() {
}
@Author(name = "Author2")
@Version(number = 4.0)
public void annotatedMethod2() {
}
}
Now write an program to makes use of the new API to read the Annotation related information that are applied on various Java
Elements. Write an utility method called readAnnotation() takes a parameter of type AnnotationElement which can represent a
Class, method or Constructor. Then it queries for a list of Annotations of that particular element by calling the getAnnotations()
method. Then the array is iterated to get the individual element, then made a downcast to extract the exact information –
Author.name() and Version.number().

public class AnnotationReader {

    public static void readAnnotation(Method element) {
        // Fetch annotations applied to the element
        Annotation[] annotations = element.getAnnotations();

        for (Annotation annotation : annotations) {
            if (annotation instanceof Author author) {
                // Downcast and extract Author info
                System.out.println("Author: " + author.name());
            } else if (annotation instanceof Version version) {
                // Downcast and extract Version info
                System.out.println("Version: " + version.number());
            }
        }
    }


    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            // Read annotations at the class level
            Class<?> annotatedClass = AnnotatedClass.class;
            //  readAnnotation(annotatedClass);

            // Read annotations for each method
            Method method1 = annotatedClass.getMethod("annotatedMethod1");
            readAnnotation(method1);

            Method method2 = annotatedClass.getMethod("annotatedMethod2");
            readAnnotation(method2);
        } catch (NoSuchMethodException e) {
            System.out.println("Method not found");;
        }
    }
}
